# Changelog for December 31st 2020

## Kira
- Fixed the redgif command to try to find a high resolution gif, but will settle for lower and lower until it can find a valid one
- Fixed the redgif command to report an error if you don't give it a search term (instead of remaining silent)
- Reorganized the code a bit to make things easier:
  - All of the extensions that are there for program-level or behind-the-scenes stuff have been renamed to be "helpers" and have their own subfolder in extensions
  - Instead of importing the config or responses files where needed, I created a datahelper that imports it and attaches relevant pieces of data to the bot itself.
    - This includes both error response messages as well as things like who the bot owners are and valid channels, etc
- ~~Added heartbeat functionality so that hopefully the bot will keep itself alive.~~ DISABLED. It appears timer-based tasks are not working on repl
  - Currently it's defaulted to 5 minute intervals (at which point it will make a get request to google.com, and print an acknowledgement to console)
  - I included a few commands to work with this:
    - %chb which takes a number, in seconds, to change the interval to
    - %stophb which stops the heartbeats
    - %starthb which starts the heartbeats (or yells at you if it's already started)
- Currently in the middle of redoing the help command, as well as adding docstrings to all of the commands in order to make useful help info available
