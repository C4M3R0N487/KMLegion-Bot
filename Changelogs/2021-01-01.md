# Changelog for January 1st 2021

# Kira
- Created moderator extension for all moderator-related functionality
  - added a listener and (very basic) parsing function that will allow auto-approval of intros. Though, the best way to use it will be to instead add all correct intros into a queue that can be bulk accepted or manually gone through
